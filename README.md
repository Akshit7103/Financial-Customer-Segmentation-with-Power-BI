Introduction
In the competitive financial services industry, understanding customer behavior is crucial for developing effective marketing strategies and personalized services. This project uses clustering and decision tree techniques to segment customers and gain actionable insights. The integration of Power BI allows for dynamic visualizations that help in making data-driven decisions.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Removing any missing or inconsistent data to ensure the quality of the dataset.
Normalization: Scaling numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to improve the performance of clustering algorithms.
Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is used to create additional features that may improve the performance of the clustering and decision tree models. This includes:

Derived Features: Creating new features from existing data, such as calculating the average transaction value or the number of transactions per customer.
Interaction Features: Combining features to capture interactions between them, which might be predictive of customer behavior.
Clustering Techniques
Various clustering techniques are used to segment the customers, including:

K-Means Clustering: This technique partitions the data into K clusters where each customer belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
Hierarchical Clustering: This technique builds a hierarchy of clusters either in a top-down or bottom-up approach.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This technique groups together closely packed points and marks points in low-density regions as outliers.
Decision Tree Model
A Decision Tree model is used to classify customer behaviors based on the clustered data. This model helps in understanding the factors influencing customer segmentation by:

Training: Using the clustered data to train the decision tree, learning the decision rules that classify the customers into different segments.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Feature Importance: Identifying the most important features that influence the segmentation, which can provide insights for targeted marketing.
Model Deployment
The models are deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive web application for users to explore the segmentation results and insights. The steps involved are:

Building the Streamlit App: Creating a user-friendly interface to input data, preprocess it, apply clustering and decision tree models, and visualize the results.
Interactive Visualizations: Displaying the segmentation results using interactive charts and graphs that allow users to explore the data dynamically.
Power BI Integration
Power BI is used to create dynamic dashboards and visualizations for the segmented customer data. These visualizations help in deriving actionable insights and enhancing data-driven decision-making by:

Connecting to Data Sources: Importing the processed data into Power BI.
Creating Dashboards: Designing interactive dashboards that display key metrics and trends.
Drill-Down Analysis: Allowing users to drill down into specific segments to gain deeper insights.
